\section{Known Bugs}

This appendix is a partial list of known bugs in Obvius.  Other bugs
are listed in the file {\tt \abox{obv}/TODO.soon} and {\tt
\abox{obv}/TODO}.  They will be fixed in a future release of the
system.

\begin{description}

\item {\bf 1D/2D} images have some inconsistencies.  In particular,
many of the synthetic image generating functions break on
one-d-images, and you can not setf iref a one-d-image.  We plan to
extend Obvius so that images (and all viewables) can be any rank (like
arrays).

\item {\bf Hardcopy} still needs lots of work.

\item {\bf Multiple Screens} are not yet supported.

\item {\bf 24bit Displays} are not yet supported.

\item {\bf Pyramids} do not necessarily work correctly on
one-d-images.  Qmf-pyramids do not work at all.

\item {\bf Screen color} does not update all pictures, e.g., pasteups
and graph flipbooks will have the wrong background color.
